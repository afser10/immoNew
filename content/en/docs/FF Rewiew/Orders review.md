<strong>Welcome to the review team!</strong>
</div>

Our responsibilities include reviewing orders completed by other drafters before sending the final plan to the customer for review.  Below are the topics you need to know to effectively perform the tasks of a reviewer.

## How to take an order for review
After drafter has drawn and finished, the order automatically goes to  AWAIT_IN_REVIEW  status.
<p>
These orders can be found on the main page of the  <a href="https://app.immoviewer.com/ff-ui/login?returnUrl=%2Forders" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #006A8A;" target="_blank"><strong>Immoviewer Furnished Floorplans</strong></a>  platform. Filter by    AWAIT_IN_REVIEW  status (by ticking this option).
<p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/2023-09-27_135339 (2).jpg" data-lightbox="example-1">
    <img src="/2023-09-27_135339 (2).jpg" alt="figure"  style="width: 700px;" />
  </a>
</div>

You should take the order for review based on the closer deadline. After you've accessed the main order page by clicking the "pencil" icon on the right, click the **"Start review"** button.
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/2023-09-27_153806.jpg" data-lightbox="example-1">
    <img src="/2023-09-27_153806.jpg" alt="figure"  style="width: 700px;" />
  </a>
</div>
The order is reviewing now, its status  IN_REVIEW  (internal review).
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/2023-10-02_16-52-10 (1).png" data-lightbox="example-1">
    <img src="/2023-10-02_16-52-10 (1).png" alt="figure"  style="width: 300px;" />
  </a>
</div>
For a better quality review, it is recommended to open each floor in a new tab, as well as to leave one tab for displaying the main page of the order. This is necessary to keep all comments to the order and all attached files are available  during the review.
<br><br>

## Live Order Review
<br>

### On the order page:

1. Read and translate the order comment.
2. Review the attached files (Attachments). These files may contain photos of the house that can help recreate the environment, sections to help you understand the roof structure, additional information about room areas, orientations.
3. Download the files before you start reviewing and editing. If you need to provide feedback, you'll be able to use them.
4. Now, go to the editor page and start the floor-by-floor review.
   <br>
   <br>
### Checklist for review:

1. Verify the scale of the plan. Some deviation is acceptable, but the plan's proportions should be maintained and as close as possible to real values.
2. Check for all walls, windows, doors, openings, roof elements, stairs.
3. Ensure that there are no missing terraces/balconies/garages. Is the front yard area shown if it exists in the original plan.
4. Verify the correctness of all room names in German ‚Äì this is very important! The most common errors are related to spelling mistakes. Remember that it's better to miss a name than to write it incorrectly.
5. Check that all order requirements have been completed (Workorder Info). Note that information about specifying the area with "ca." can be found on the order page (Square meter specification Type - Circa/‚Äûca.‚Äú vor Quadratmeterangabe).
6. Verify the presence of floor textures.
7. If there are 2 or more floors of the same house in the order, check whether all floors are in the same position relative to the sides of the world, match in terms of stair direction, and have consistent floor dimensions!
8. Check if the stairs are correctly drawn on all floors.
9. Verify that the room name matches its furnishings.
10. Ensure that objects are proportional to each other and to the room as a whole.
11. Check if the distances between the room name and its area are consistent in all rooms.
12. Ensure that they are correctly positioned according to style standards:

- dimension linesfloor name
- north arrow
- watermarks
- vertical position of the plan

13. Save the changes and download the plans for all floors. Review once again how the plans will appear to the client. This is an important step to catch any details that may be unnoticed on the editor's page.

Once the review is complete you need to send the order to **External Provider for review**.
<div style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/image-1696251371682.png" data-lightbox="example-1">
    <img src="/image-1696251371682.png" alt="figure"  style="width: 700px;" />
  </a>
</div>

When you click this button, the order is immediately delivered to the customer. If we make any changes to the plan in other open tabs after sending it, these changes will be saved when you press the Save button, but the customer will not see these updates on the platform.  Therefore, before sending, make sure that everything is exactly as it should be sent and only then click **Send to External Provider**.
<br>   <br>

## Reporting
After submitting the order for customer review, you need to fill out the FF progress reporting table.

Before working with the table, make sure that the Google account you are using has the correct time zone settings for your location. To do this, go to **Google Calendar - Settings - Time Zone** and select the current region.



In the table, find the relevant order and fill in the following columns:
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/2023-09-27_172520.jpg" data-lightbox="example-1">

  </a>
</div>

<div style="background-color: rgba(240, 240, 240, 0.5); padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr style="background-color: rgba(220, 220, 220, 0.5);">
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: right; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><strong>Status </strong></td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">From   In progress   change it to External review , by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown list. The delivery time will be displayed in the "1 Delivery Date" column automatically according to the time in Germany. This should be done immediately after sending so that the actual sending time and the time specified in the table match.
This data is necessary for the correct calculation of the waiting time for the customer. The earlier the order is delivered - the higher the quality of teamwork and our advantage over our competitors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: right; border: 1px solid #ccc;"><strong>Reviewer</strong></td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">Enter your name exactly as it is written in your Slack account. Please do not change the text format (font Arial, size 10 pt). If the order was reviewed by an intern-reviewer together with a mentor, you should enter both names in full, separated by commas, where the first name is the intern and the second name is the mentor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: rgba(220, 220, 220, 0.5);">

      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">The order is drawn cleanly and accurately with a minimum number of corrections (1-2), the drafter took appropriate time for the complexity of the order. The review took no more than 5-7 minutes (mostly for familiarization with the materials).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: rgba(220, 220, 220, 0.5);">
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">üòä</td>

      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">The order is drawn well in general, but there are 1-2 unacceptable errors. For example, one of the requirements is missing or a comment is ignored, there are 1-2 errors in names, furniture and equipment are not accurately arranged, correction took about 10 minutes per floor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">üòê</td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">3</td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">Elements of the plan were missed, there were errors in the room names, adjustments to the walls were required, customer comments and the Workorder info requirements were ignored. Revisions took approximately 15 minutes per floor or more.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: rgba(220, 220, 220, 0.5);">
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">üôÅ</td>

      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">One of the floors had to be redrawn because of the wrong scale. Floors do not match in dimensions, many other errors and corrections. It took more than 20-30 minutes to review (depending on the complexity and number of floors).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">üò°</td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #ccc;">1</td>
      <td style="padding: 5px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ccc;">Need to redraw all the floors. This is possible if the drafter made a significant scale error. In this case, if the order is not "urgent" and the drafter who made such an error is still on shift, it is advisable to allow the drafter to redraw it themselves to prevent such a critical error from happening again in the future.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

It is also necessary to consider the time spent on the order and the review with corrections. The complexity of the order, area can affect the time. Try to evaluate all factors objectively and provide  an unbiased rating.
