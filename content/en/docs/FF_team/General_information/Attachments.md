**1. Photos of the room** - in this case it is necessary to repeat the arrangement of furniture as in the room.

**2. Specifications** - a list of rooms with areas. If there is such a file - it provides more accurate room areas, and you should use this information for to arrange the areas.

**3. Sections and facades** - they can help to better understand the building, the placement of stairs, where mansard windows are in the attic, and where are the dormers. Very rarely, but there may be a request from a client to draw a section. In such a case you should make sure that such a request exists by contacting supervisors in the **[#ff-issues](https://ivds-fpteam.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC046FGX9UFP%3Fname%3DC046FGX9UFP)** channel.

**Comments on the main order page.**

Frequently the customer leaves special comments on the order main page. Translate them from German and take them into account when completing the order. Ignoring the comments is a serious mistake. Usually specific requirements are specified in the comments. Supervisors can also leave comments on the order, if necessary.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/21.53.40.png" data-lightbox="example-1" >
    <img src="/21.53.40.png" alt="figure"  />
  </a>
</div>

It is very convenient to use an extension **[ https://www.deepl.com/en/chrome-extension](https://www.deepl.com/en/chrome-extension)** for Google Chrome, which allows you to make a quick and quite accurate translation without leaving the order page:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/21.53.45.png" data-lightbox="example-1" >
    <img src="/21.53.45.png" alt="figure"  />
  </a>
</div>
