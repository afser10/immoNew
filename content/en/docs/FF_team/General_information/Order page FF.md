<p>If your name is displayed under the word <strong>Assignee</strong> and the <strong>Start Drawing</strong> button is active, the order is assigned to you. You should start working on it as soon as your shift starts, or immediately after you have completed the previous order. If for some reason the button is inactive but you have an order assigned to you in Slack, contact the #ff-issues channel or supervisors.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Information under the Start Drawing button.</h2>
<p>Information about the customer, the style in which the work should be performed and the time of uploading the order to the site is given opposite the items Customer, Library, Style, Creation Date.</p>
<p>These 4 items are defined by the customer when forming the order.</p>

  <strong>It is important to remember that all orders are reviewed and, you should submit your order as soon as possible, as depending on the size and complexity of the order, the reviewer needs time to review and make corrections before final submission.</strong>
</p>

<p>Delivery shows us how many hours are left until the order is due. If the order is overdue, these hours will be displayed in red.</p>

<h3>Drawing type:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wohnungen einzeln zeichnen / Single Plan</strong> - draw apartments individually. This means that you only need to draw one apartment on the floor plan. Often this apartment is already marked on the source (with color, a checkmark, or a bold line) or the apartment number is provided by the customer in the comments.</li>
  <p style="color: #7F6416; background-color: #FDF2CE; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 16px;">
    <strong>If an apartment is not marked in any way and you cannot determine which apartment you need to draw, please contact the <span style="color: #2969B1;">#ff-issues</span> channel or supervisors. If necessary, this information will be clarified with the client.</strong>
  </p>
  <li><strong>Ganzes Geschoss zeichnen / Entire Floor</strong> - to draw the whole floor. In this case it is necessary to draw all apartments on the floor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other order requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Furniture - arrange furniture</li>
  <li>Square Meter - write room areas</li>
  <li>North Arrow - put the north arrow</li>
  <li>Room Designation - write room names</li>
  <li>FloorPlan Designation - write floor names.</li>
  <li>Align North - align the plan to the north (so that the north points upwards).</li>

  <li>Meter bars - place a scale bar</li>
  <li>Square Meter Spec - how to write area values</li>

</ul>

<p style="color: #7F6416; background-color: #FDF2CE; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 16px;">
  <strong>Whether to fulfill these requirements or not depends on whether there is a "YES" or "NO" marked next to them. They are also duplicated on the editor's page.</strong>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/21.44.03.png" data-lightbox="box">
    <img src="/21.44.03.png" alt="figure" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>On the order page, you will also see information about how many floors you need to draw:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <a href="/21.44.37.png" data-lightbox="box">
    <img src="/21.44.37.png" alt="figure" />
  </a>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
